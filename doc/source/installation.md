# Installation

`variete` only depends on [rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio) and its sub-dependencies.
If `rasterio` is installed and it works [(see their installation page)](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html), `variete` can be installed with one of the following:

```bash
pip install variete
```

or, for the latest main branch commit:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/erikmannerfelt/variete.git
```
